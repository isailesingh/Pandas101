How to install Pandas
To install Pandas, follow these steps:

-> Step 1: Open Your Command Line Interface (CLI)

Windows: Open Command Prompt (Search for "cmd" or "Command Prompt").
MacOS/Linux: Open Terminal.

-> Step 2: Install Pandas using pip
Run the following command:

pip install pandas

If you are using Python 3 (which is the most common case nowadays), you might want to use pip3 instead of pip:

pip3 install pandas

-> Step 3: Verify Installation
After installation, you can check if Pandas was installed successfully by running the following command:

python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.version)"

This will print the installed version of Pandas.
